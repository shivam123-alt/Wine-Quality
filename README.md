The Wine Quality dataset contains physicochemical properties of red or white wines and a quality rating (usually between 0 and 10).
Visualizing this dataset using Python helps in understanding relationships between variables and identifying patterns that affect wine quality.

1. Libraries Commonly Used

Pandas – For loading and manipulating the dataset.

Matplotlib and Seaborn – For plotting charts and heatmaps.
